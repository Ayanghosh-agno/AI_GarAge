## What is AI-GARAGE?

The AI GARAGE is a prototype of the smart garage system, which is one of the essential needs of a smart home. These doors not only help from burglars but also closes on its own as soon as it senses that someone took the car out. Unlike a manual garage door, the smart garage door gives a tough time to the thieves for entering the house. Similarly It also gives the owner a hassle free entry to the garage as soon as the System recognizes either the car number plate or the face. The project provides the user with a simple monitoring system that enables them to act more security conscious, effectively increasing the safety and security of their home with the use of some latest technology Like AI,ML and IoT implemented in the IBM cloud.
